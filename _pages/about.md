## About Me
I am a dedicated and innovative Data Scientist with nearly two years of experience at Amrock, a forefront title insurance company in Detroit. My role at Amrock revolves around leveraging Python and SQL to extract and wrangle large datasets, perform insightful data visualizations, and develop predictive models using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. My responsibilities also extend to drafting detailed documentation and reports, providing actionable business insights to stakeholders, and contributing to the development of data-driven decision-making platforms.

Prior to my role at Amrock, I accomplished my Ph.D. in Statistics from Oklahoma State University and hold a Master’s in Applied Statistics from Rochester Institute of Technology. During my academic journey, I accumulated seven years of experience in studying, working, and researching, including a stint as a Data Analyst, where I employed R programming for exploratory data analysis and model development.

My foundation in statistics and data science is built upon a solid theoretical understanding and practical knowledge acquired through academic pursuits and industry experience. Passionate about continuous learning, I am committed to enhancing my skills in Python and SQL coding, machine learning, deep learning, and communication to foster effective team collaboration. I believe in the endless pursuit of knowledge as the catalyst for success in a data science career, and I continuously strive for professional and personal development to stay abreast of industry advancements.

In my leisure time, I craft detailed study plans focusing on technology mastery and collaborative skills enhancement, ensuring perpetual growth and adaptability in the dynamic field of data science. My journey at Amrock has not only sharpened my technical acumen but also molded me into a team player, eager to contribute to collective goals and objectives.

## Hobbies
### Cooking
Outside the realm of numbers, models, and datasets, I find solace and joy in the culinary arts, specifically in crafting delectable Chinese dishes. Cooking is more than just a hobby for me; it's a canvas where I can blend flavors, experiment with ingredients, and create something unique and satisfying. I especially love cooking for my wife, exploring new recipes, and revisiting traditional ones to bring a slice of culinary delight to our everyday lives. This hobby is not just about the act of cooking but also about sharing, learning, and experiencing diverse food cultures, which, I believe, resonate well with my professional journey of constant learning and sharing knowledge. Whether it’s in the kitchen perfecting a dish or at work optimizing a model, the pursuit of mastery and the joy of sharing are the essences that drive me.
