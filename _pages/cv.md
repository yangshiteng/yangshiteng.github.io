## üíº Experience
### Amrock, LLC
***Data Scientist***

*Jan 2022 - Present, Detroit, MI*

-	Utilized Python to implement exploratory data analysis, algorithms optimization and machine learning models
development (eg. XGBoost) for a total of 9 modules in an API platform that provides client data auto-validation service,
which greatly improved the performance of this platform by reducing the overall false passing rate from 30% to 4%
-	Built a data access module enabling the client data auto-validation platform to independently access third-party data
sources, resulting in a significant reduction of the data missing rate from 12% to 3%
-	Deployed a data extractor service to production to help business team automate the parsing and typing process of a
business clause, lowering the error rate from 11% to only 1% and reducing the workload on policy examiners
- Query, mine and analyze large complex data sets using SQL and Python to answer business questions

### Rocket Companies
***Data Scientist Intern***

*May 2019 ‚Äì Aug 2019, Detroit, MI*

- Completed an urgent request to fix an issue of incompatibility with Scikit-learn tree models by utilizing the Python
sklearn-json package in just 2 days, which was much earlier than the expected deadline
-	Wrangled large, complex data sets to provide insight into opportunities to improve or automate the business processes

### Oklahoma State University
***Data Analyst***

*May 2019 ‚Äì Aug 2019, Stillwater, OK*

- Supported teaching faculties in department of statistics on a research project that aims to evaluate the overall
performance of undergraduate students enrolled in statistical courses through data analysis and statistical modeling
- Utilized R studio to perform exploratory data analysis, such as, data visualization and missing value imputation
- Trained three statistical models (linear, logistic and ordinal regression) to detect the influential features on students‚Äô
course performance, and proposed suggestions that led to 26% increase in the course pass rate

## üéì Education
### Oklahoma State University
**Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Statistics**

*Aug 2016 ‚Äì Dec 2021, Stillwater, OK*

- Coursework: Advanced Calculus, Real Analysis, Experimental Designs, Statistical Inference, Statistical Computing, Multivariate Analysis, Probability Theory, Advanced Statistical Inference, Large Sample Inference

### Rochester Institute of Technology
**Master of Science (M.S.) in Applied Statistics**

*Aug 2014 ‚Äì May 2016, Rochester, NY*

- Coursework: Statistical Software, Regression Analysis, Theory of Statistics, Principles Stats Data Mining, Time Series

### Hangzhou Dianzi University
**Bachelor of Economics (B.Ec) in Statistics**

*Sep 2009 ‚Äì May 2013, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China*

- Coursework: Linear Algebra, Higher Mathematics, Sampling Theory

## üìù Research Experience
### Ph.D. Research - Parameter Estimation with Monte Carlo Sampling

- Developed a parameter estimation algorithm for economic models based on EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm
and Monte Carlo sampling, which reduced the computation time by 60% and improved the performance by 70%
- Ph.D. Dissertation: [Maximum likelihood estimation under efficient importance sampling for non-linear state space models](https://shareok.org/handle/11244/335744)

### M.S. Research - Singer Identification with Statistical Modeling

- Employed R studio to build a Gaussian mixture model for the detection of singers‚Äô identity based on singing voice data,
achieving 96% identification accuracy which is 16% higher than the models based on machine learning techniques
- M.S. Thesis: [Statistical Approaches for Signal Processing with Application to Automatic Singer Identification](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/9138/)
